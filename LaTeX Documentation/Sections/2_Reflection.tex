\section{Reflection}
\label{sec:reflection}

\textbf{In 3-5 pages, 1500-2000 words}\\

The purpose of the reflection is to show that you can reflect and assess your own work and learning process critically.\\

This section needs to be adjusted to align with the reflection requirements specified in the selected task.\\

\textbf{Note:} You should address all the questions from your selected task. Please list each question and provide your answers in the following enumeration.\\

For example:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   What was the most interesting thing that you learnt while working on the portfolio?
            What aspects did you find interesting or surprising? 
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    This is my answer...
    
    \item   Which part of the portfolio are you (most) proud of?
            Why?
            What were the challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them? 

    \textbf{Answer:}
    This is my answer...

    \item   What adjustments to your design and implementation were necessary during the implementation phase?
            What would you change or do differently if you had to do the portfolio task a second time?
            What would be potential areas for future improvement?
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    1.
    2. If I had the chance to do it again or allocate more time to the portfolio earlier, 
    I would really like to figure out what the difference is between the regular version of llama and 
    the instruction-tuned version of llama that causes the instruction-tuned version of llama 
    to support pipeline messages while the regular version of llama does not.
    And when the implementation was really fine\-tuned, I realized that the translation type is a seq2seq task, 
    and using a large seq2seq model may have better results. However, llama is of the casual_LM type, so I have to use the instruction version to convert the translation task into a reasoning task about translation.
    3.

    \item   Include a brief section on ethical considerations when using these models on language translation tasks.
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    See Section~\ref{sec:ethics} on page~\pageref{sec:ethics}.

    \item   From the lecture/course including guest lectures, what topic excited you the most?
            Why?
            What would you like to learn more about and why?
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    This is my answer...

    \item   How did you find working with DIFY platform during the course work?
            Would you recommend using DIFY in learning Generative AI technologies and why?
            What is the best start for learning Generative AI either by Python code or No-code platforms and why?
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    This is my answer...

    \item   How did you find the assignments and exercises in the course and how they help you in portfolio exam?
    
    \textbf{Answer:}
    This is my answer...
